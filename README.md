# Denoising diffusion model replication
This project was made in collaboration with @PhilipTamb for the course "Cognitive Computing & Artificial Intelligence" @ University of Catania. <br />
The file contains a Pytorch code for training the diffusion model described by [this paper] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11239.pdf). We're also using the [code] (https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch) by @lucidrain for the implementation of Unet, Gaussian Diffusion and the trainer class. <br />
ATTENTION! This code only works with Google Colab, if you want to try it on your own GPU you must do some adjustments. <br />
For more details, you can read the documentation which is the pdf file of the repo (don't worry, this time is in english :P )
